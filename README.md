>
> This is the class you need to use to make your code run faster.
>
> There's just one problem. No one knows about it (or how to use it well).
>
> Introducing: "Python ThreadPool Jump-Start". A new book designed to teach you thread pools in Python, super fast!
>
> You will get a rapid-paced, 7-part course to get you started and make you awesome at using the ThreadPool.
